## Feature Description:

HopeOneSource’s partnered organizations serve more than just English speakers, and for this reason it’s important that messages be translated into other languages. As messages about available career, housing & social services are sent out by service providers via the HopeOneSource platform, our volunteer translators are notified. They use the translation feature to translate each message of available services (the who, what, when, where, contact info & eligibility requirements) from English into other applicable languages (currently, Spanish).

Our mission is to help prevent and end homelessness for everyone, regardless of their native language. By translating the text messages, we can include more people on this platform.
